# Feature Specification: Streamlit Task Management UI

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a simple streamlit application on top of the SQLite database layer that we have created previously.  The UI should be relatively minimalistic.  The user should be able to add new tasks, remove tasks, check tasks off and view completed tasks, read @specs/001-a-database-layer/spec.md for reference"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need a simple, intuitive interface to manage their personal tasks. They should be able to quickly add new tasks, mark them as complete when finished, remove unwanted tasks, and review their completed work history. The interface should be clean and minimalistic to avoid distractions from task management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user opens the application, **When** they enter a task description and submit it, **Then** the new task appears in their active task list
2. **Given** user has active tasks displayed, **When** they mark a task as completed, **Then** the task moves from active to completed status and shows completion timestamp
3. **Given** user has tasks in their list, **When** they choose to remove a task, **Then** the task is permanently deleted from the system
4. **Given** user has completed tasks, **When** they navigate to view completed tasks, **Then** they see all previously completed tasks with completion details
5. **Given** user has both active and completed tasks, **When** they switch between views, **Then** they see only the appropriate tasks for each view

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user tries to add a task with empty description?
- How does the interface handle very long task descriptions?
- What happens when user has no tasks in either active or completed states?
- How does the system respond when user tries to complete an already completed task?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a text input field for users to enter new task descriptions
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all active (incomplete) tasks in a clear, readable format
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to mark individual tasks as completed with a single action
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to permanently remove tasks from the system
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a separate view or section for completed tasks
- **FR-006**: System MUST show completion timestamps for completed tasks
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist all task operations using the existing database layer
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide visual distinction between active and completed tasks
- **FR-009**: System MUST update the interface immediately after any task operation
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain a minimalistic, distraction-free visual design
- **FR-011**: System MUST integrate with the existing SQLite database layer without modifications to the database schema
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle empty task lists gracefully in both active and completed views

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Task Display Item**: Visual representation of a task showing description, status, creation time, and available actions
- **Task Action**: User operations available on tasks (complete, remove) based on current task status
- **View State**: Current interface mode showing either active tasks, completed tasks, or both
