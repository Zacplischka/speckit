# Feature Specification: Database Layer for To-Do Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-database-layer`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "A database layer for a simple to-do application, the user should be able to add tasks, mark tasks as completed and look at previous tasks. we will only be planning and implementing the database layer using an SQLite database"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need a reliable way to manage their tasks by creating new tasks, tracking their completion status, and reviewing their task history. The system should preserve all task data and allow users to distinguish between pending and completed tasks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no existing tasks, **When** user creates a new task with description "Buy groceries", **Then** the task is stored and can be retrieved later
2. **Given** a pending task exists, **When** user marks the task as completed, **Then** the task status changes to completed and completion time is recorded
3. **Given** multiple tasks exist with different statuses, **When** user requests to view all tasks, **Then** system returns all tasks with their current status
4. **Given** tasks have been completed previously, **When** user requests task history, **Then** system returns all previous tasks with their completion details

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user tries to mark an already completed task as completed again?
- How does system handle empty or null task descriptions?
- What happens when user requests tasks but none exist?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow creation of new tasks with descriptive text
- **FR-002**: System MUST persist all task data permanently until explicitly deleted
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow marking tasks as completed
- **FR-004**: System MUST track completion timestamp when tasks are marked complete
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide ability to retrieve all tasks regardless of status
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide ability to retrieve only pending (incomplete) tasks
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide ability to retrieve only completed tasks
- **FR-008**: System MUST assign unique identifiers to each task for reference
- **FR-009**: System MUST record task creation timestamp
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent data loss during normal system operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Task**: Represents a user-defined action item with description, creation time, completion status, and optional completion time
- **Task Status**: Represents the current state of a task (pending or completed)
