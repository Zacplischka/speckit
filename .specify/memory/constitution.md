# SpecKit Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Library-First
Every feature MUST be implemented as a standalone library with clear interfaces. Libraries MUST be self-contained, independently testable, and documented with explicit purpose. No organizational-only libraries without clear functional value.

**Rationale**: Modular design enables reusability, testability, and maintainability while preventing tight coupling.

### II. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test-Driven Development is mandatory. Tests MUST be written before implementation, MUST fail initially, then implementation MUST make them pass. Red-Green-Refactor cycle MUST be strictly enforced.

**Rationale**: TDD ensures code quality, validates requirements understanding, and provides regression protection.

### III. Simplicity
Start simple and apply YAGNI principles. Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements. Additional complexity MUST be justified against measurable needs, not anticipated requirements.

**Rationale**: Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, debug, and extend when actually needed.

### IV. Clear Purpose
Every module, library, and component MUST have a single, well-defined responsibility. Purpose MUST be documentable in one sentence without "and" or "or" conjunctions.

**Rationale**: Single responsibility enables independent development, testing, and reasoning about code behavior.

### V. Interface Compliance
All implementations MUST adhere to defined contracts and abstract interfaces. Breaking interface changes require major version bumps and migration documentation.

**Rationale**: Interface compliance enables substitutability, testing with mocks, and prevents implementation leakage.

## Quality Standards

### Testing Requirements
- Contract tests MUST validate interface adherence
- Integration tests MUST cover user scenarios from specifications
- Unit tests MUST achieve >90% coverage for business logic
- Performance tests MUST validate non-functional requirements

### Documentation Standards
- All public APIs MUST have docstrings with examples
- Quickstart guides MUST be executable and validated
- Architecture decisions MUST be documented with rationale

### Performance Standards
- Database operations MUST complete in <10ms for simple CRUD
- Memory usage MUST remain under specified constraints
- Performance degradation requires justification and monitoring

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development
1. Specification phase: Business requirements without implementation details
2. Planning phase: Technical design with constitutional compliance check
3. Task generation: TDD-ordered implementation tasks
4. Implementation: Execute tasks following constitutional principles
5. Validation: Performance, integration, and acceptance testing

### Code Review Requirements
- All changes MUST verify constitutional compliance
- Performance impact MUST be assessed for non-trivial changes
- Breaking changes MUST be explicitly flagged and justified

### Quality Gates
- Pre-implementation: Constitutional compliance verified
- Post-implementation: All tests passing, performance validated
- Pre-deployment: Integration tests and manual validation complete

## Governance

The constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require explicit documentation, approval process, and migration plan for affected code.

All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify constitutional compliance. Violations MUST be addressed before merge approval. Complexity deviations MUST be documented with justification in project documentation.
